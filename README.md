The content for each question (question, answer and image) are stored as object which in turn is stored in an array.
When a new question object is added to the array, it is automatically available to be displayed in the quiz.
The HTML elements these questions are displayed in are created dynamically, meaning the number of questions can be increased or decreased by changing a single line of code in the Javascript file rather than updating the HTML file.
Which questions are displayed and the order they appear in are also a result of the Javascript file, meaning each time the page is reloaded a new quiz is served to the user.
